        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Ethan Mader, a Computer Science PhD student at Purdue University. My research focuses on graph algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and randomized algorithms. I am being advised by Kent Quanrud.</p>
        <p>I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in Spring 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics. I love theory, and am hoping to apply my abstract skillset to practical problems.</p>
        <p>I am currently searching for summer 2025/2026 internships in quantitative research / analysis. Eventually, though, I want to pivot to theoretical industry resarch in algorithms or quantum computing.</p>

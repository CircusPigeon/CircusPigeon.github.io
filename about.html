                <p>Hello! I am Ethan Mader, a Computer Science PhD student at Purdue University. My research focuses on graph algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and randomized algorithms. I am being advised by Kent Quanrud.</p>
                <p>I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in Spring 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics. I love theory, and am hoping to apply my abstract skillset to practical problems.</p>
                <p>I am currently searching for summer 2026 internships in quantitative research. In the future, I would like to consider a career in industry research for algorithms.</p>
